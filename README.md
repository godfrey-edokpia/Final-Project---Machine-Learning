# Final-Project---Machine-Learning: As a team, we set out to determine the best days to have outside events in the Charlotte area. We pulled weather data for the Charlotte area and used temperature classifications to categorize days as Good or Bad. For example, we decided a good day had an average temperature between 70-80 degrees with no precipitation. (Pandas, HTML, Tableau and Excel, â€¦.)
